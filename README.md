# Project_A
2D C++ Video Game Project
The game will be written from scratch in mainly C++. It is a first jump into game development as well as the C++ language. The game itself will be a 2D-style
RPG adventure, with all the usuals of the genre included (NPCs, combat, varying storyline outcomes). I would also like to implement some amount of machine 
learning alongside the NPC AI.

Getting Started
TODO

Prerequesites
TO COMPLETE
-MinGW for a Windows environment (not sure how easy it will be to run on a Linux environment, I'm assuming it'll actually be easier)
-The IDE of your choice (I used Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers v: 2019-12(4.14.0))
-The SFML files are already in the project library files. My installation, however, has issues, as debugging isn't functional (other parts of 
SFML may also not be working properly, this may come up later in development when other functions are used).
